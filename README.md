Step 1: git add . --> stages all the files, can specify file instead of writing . 
Step 2: git commit -m "commit message" --> commits the files that were added
step 3: git push origin main --> pushes commits to the repository 

in case want to do branches 
git branch branch-name --> create a new branch 
git switch branch-name --> change to branch then just commit from there 
git status --> check which branch on 

others: 
git checkout commit-code --> checkout a specific commit


What not to do!
DO NOT COMMIT ur temperorary files 
DO NOT edit the file at the same time as someone else to prevent conflicts
